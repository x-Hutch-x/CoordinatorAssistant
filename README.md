# Coordinator Assistant

**Coordinator Assistant** is a lightweight desktop tool built with **C++17** and **wxWidgets**.  
It helps streamline coordination workflows by making repetitive file-based tasks easier to manage.

## Features

- **Framework:** wxWidgets (UI + event handling)  
- **Build System:** CMake (using vcpkg for dependency management)  
- **Target:** Windows 10/11 desktop  

## Status
- ✅ Foundation complete: main window, menus, event table wiring.  
- 🚧 In progress: top-bar actions, workflow tabs, CSV integration, email helper.  
- 📌 Planned: metrics dashboard, refined UX, and advanced reporting tools.  

## Why This Project
This project demonstrates:
- Practical **desktop GUI development** in modern C++.  
- Using **wxWidgets** with event tables for clear, maintainable UI code.  
- Organizing builds with **CMake** and **vcpkg**.  
- Designing real-world workflow automation in a modular, extensible way.
